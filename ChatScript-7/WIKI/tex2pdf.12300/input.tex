\section{ChatScript}\label{chatscript}

Natural Language tool/dialog manager

ChatScript is the next generation chatbot engine that has won the
Loebner's 4 times and is the basis for natural language company for a
variety of tech startups.

ChatScript is a rule-based engine, where rules are created by humans
writers in program scripts through a process called dialog flow
scripting. These use a scripting metalanguage (simply called a
``script'') as their source code. Here what a ChatScript script file
looks like:

\begin{verbatim}
#
# file: food.top
#
topic: ~food []

#! I like spinach
s: ( I like spinach ) Are you a fan of the Popeye cartoons?
    a: ( yes )  I used to watch him as a child. Did you lust after Olive Oyl?
            b: ( no ) Me neither. She was too skinny.
            b: ( yes ) You probably like skinny models.
    a: ( no ) What cartoons do you watch?
            b: ( none ) You lead a deprived life.
            b: ( Mickey Mouse ) The Disney icon.

#! I often eat chicken
u: ( ![ not never rarely ] I * ~ingest * ~meat ) You eat meat.

#! I really love chicken
u: ( !~negativeWords I * ~like * ~meat ) You like meat.

#! do you eat bacon?
?: (do you eat _ [ ham eggs bacon]) I eat '_0

#! do you like eggs or sushi?
?: (do you like _* or _*) I don't like '_0 so I guess that means I prefer '_1.

#! I adore kiwi.
s: ( ~like ~fruit ![~animal _bear] )  Vegan, you too...

#! do you eat steak?
?: (do you eat _~meat) No, I hate _0.

#! I eat fish.
s: ( I eat _*1 >) 
  $food = '_0 
  I eat oysters.
\end{verbatim}

\end{itemize}

\section{Getting started}\label{getting-started}

\subsection{Installation}\label{installation}

Take this project and put it into some directory on your machine
(typically we call the directory ChatScript, but you can name it
whatever). That takes care of installation.

\begin{verbatim}
git clone https://github.com/bwilcox-1234/ChatScript
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{How to run locally on a console (for
developement/test)}\label{how-to-run-locally-on-a-console-for-developementtest}

\subsubsection{Windows}\label{windows}

Go to the BINARIES directory and type \texttt{ChatScript}:

\begin{verbatim}
cd BINARIES && ChatScript
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Linux}\label{linux}

\begin{verbatim}
cd BINARIES && ./LinuxChatScript64 local
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{MacOS}\label{macos}

\begin{verbatim}
cd BINARIES && ./MacChatScript local
\end{verbatim}

This will cause ChatScript to load and ask you for a username. Enter
whatever you want. You are then talking to the default demo bot
\texttt{Harry}.

\subsection{How to run as a server (for
production)}\label{how-to-run-as-a-server-for-production}

\subsubsection{Windows}\label{windows-1}

Go to the BINARIES directory and type \texttt{ChatScript\ port=1024}

\begin{verbatim}
cd BINARIES && ChatScript port=1024
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Linux}\label{linux-1}

\begin{verbatim}
cd BINARIES && ./LinuxChatScript64
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{MacOS}\label{macos-1}

\begin{verbatim}
cd BINARIES && ./MacChatScript
\end{verbatim}

This will cause ChatScript to load as a server. But you also need a
client (to test client-server communication). You can run a separate
command window and go to the BINARIES directory and type
\texttt{ChatScript\ client=localhost:1024} if you are on Windows, or
type \texttt{./LinuxChatScript64\ client=localhost:1024} if you are on
Linux. This will cause ChatScript to load as a client and you can talk
to the server.

\subsection{How to build the engine.}\label{how-to-build-the-engine.}

On windows if you have Visual Studio installed, launch
\texttt{VS2010/chatscript.sln} or \texttt{VS2015/chatscript.sln} and do
a build. The result will go in the \texttt{BINARIES} directory.

On Linux, go stand in the SRC directory and type \texttt{make\ server}
(assuming you have make and g++ installed). This creates
BINARIES/ChatScript, which can run as a server or locally. There are
other make choices for installing PostGres or Mongo.

\subsection{How to build a bot}\label{how-to-build-a-bot}

Run ChatScript locally. From the ChatScript command prompt, type

\begin{verbatim}
:build Harry
\end{verbatim}

or whatever other preinstalled bot exists. If you have revised basic
data, you can first do \texttt{:build\ 0} .
